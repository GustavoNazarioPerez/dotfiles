### dotfiles

This repo contains all of my dotfiles. The goal is to not overcomplicate.

You can find my configuration for the following:
- neovim: text editing
- starship: better command line prompt 
- git: presets, make diff better!
- .zshrc

Note: I should probably include a setup script to install dependencies for this
