### dotfiles

This repo contains all of my dotfiles. The goal is to not overcomplicate.

You can find my configuration for the following:
- neovim: for text editing
- starship: for a more detailed command line prompt 
- gitconfig: for a better git workflow
- my .zshrc

Note: I should probably include a setup script to install dependencies for this
